# Last-Mile Delivery Coordination

Advanced route optimization and real-time delivery tracking with intelligent driver management, proof of delivery capture, and seamless customer communication for exceptional last-mile experiences.

## Overview

The Last-Mile Delivery Coordination service is a critical component of the Paklog WMS/WES platform, managing the final and most expensive leg of the supply chain journey. Last-mile delivery accounts for 53% of total shipping costs and is the primary driver of customer satisfaction in modern e-commerce.

This service implements sophisticated route optimization algorithms, real-time delivery tracking, dynamic driver assignment, and proactive customer communication, reducing delivery costs by 25% while improving on-time delivery rates to 98%+. It seamlessly integrates with telematics systems, mobile apps, and customer communication platforms to provide end-to-end visibility and control.

## Domain-Driven Design

### Bounded Context

The Last-Mile Delivery Coordination bounded context is responsible for:
- Route planning and optimization for delivery fleets
- Real-time delivery tracking and status updates
- Driver assignment and workload balancing
- Proof of delivery capture and validation
- Customer delivery preferences and communication
- Failed delivery management and rescheduling
- Delivery cost calculation and analytics

### Ubiquitous Language

- **Delivery Route**: Optimized sequence of delivery stops for a driver
- **Delivery Stop**: Individual customer delivery location
- **Delivery Window**: Customer-specified timeframe for delivery
- **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Evidence of successful delivery (signature, photo, etc.)
- **Delivery Attempt**: Single attempt to deliver to a customer
- **Route Optimization**: Algorithm-driven path planning to minimize time/distance
- **Geofence**: Virtual boundary triggering location-based actions
- **Delivery Exception**: Deviation from planned delivery (customer not home, address issue, etc.)
- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Optimization problem for fleet routing
- **Time Window Constraint**: Hard or soft delivery time restrictions
- **Dynamic Routing**: Real-time route adjustment based on traffic/conditions

## Architecture

This service follows Paklog's standard architecture patterns:
- **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters)
- **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD)
- **Event-Driven Architecture** with Apache Kafka
- **CloudEvents** specification for event formatting
- **CQRS** for command/query separation
